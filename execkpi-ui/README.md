# ExecKPI UI (local copy)

This is a local copy of the React/Vite UI.

**Production / live deployments are built from a separate repo**: `execkpi-ui-clean` (the one currently connected to Vercel).

So:
- edit here if you want the UI code to live alongside the backend
- but deploy / test on Vercel from the `execkpi-ui-clean` repo

Backend lives here in this monorepo → `backend/` on Render.
